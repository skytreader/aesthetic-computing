# What's this?

Implementations of some of the programs described in [Aesthetic Computing](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/aesthetic-computing).
I read the book during particularly dull sessions of a certain Software Engineering
class. This was coded around early 2011.

# What now?

I really had a good time figuring out the algorithms for the programs described
in the book. As far as I remember, what has been implemented here works pretty
fine. That said, the code could still do with some cleaning.

If and when I get the time to do that, I'll be dealing with this again.
